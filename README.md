## 📚 Lessons Learned

## 🔒 Authentication with JWT

We use **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** to securely authenticate users. Tokens are signed using a secret or public/private key pair and verified on each request to protected routes.

✅ **Use Case:**  
- Check if a user is logged in  
- Protect user routes and resources  

---

## 📬 Password Reset with NodeMailer

Users can reset their passwords securely via email. We use the **NodeMailer** package to send a unique, time-sensitive reset link to the user's registered email.

✅ **Use Case:**  
- Forgot Password functionality  
- Email-based secure token generation
